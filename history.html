            Born with faith in Science, Late Sri C Sudarshan an eminent academician was the founder Principal of Bhavan’s New Science College. He began his career 
            as a Lecturer in Chemistry and was responsible for the establishment of Bhavan’s New Science College, which he headed for several years. He found Science
            as the High Priest of knowledge and held a paramount place for it in Higher education. Hailed from a simple, disciplined family devoted to Gandhian style 
            of living with a charka and spindle, Sri Sudarshan had an enkindling desire to spread Science education for the benefit of the student community. 
            He took his Post Graduate Degree in Chemistry from Osmania University and soon became a well known educationist and scholar. Carrying the quintessential 
            ideals of Bharatiya Culture through the motto Vidhyadhanam Sarva Dhan Pradhanam, he created an exclusive class of Teacher Professionals, whose united 
            efforts made New Science College as one of the finest institutions in twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. To create a centre of Higher Education,
            he introduced various combinations from Pre-University courses to Post-Graduate programs in the campus to enable students pursue their focused study. 
            With application of science and technology as a driving force of national development, Sri C. Sudarshan endeavored to make science education both 
            professional and affordable to all sections of society.
            The purpose of higher education, he advocated, should enhance its contribution to qualitative development of society. The road map being laid, Bhavan’s
            New Science College has been journeying through five plus glorious decades towards scientific excellence to provide the student community the best of 
            learning and teaching opportunities. We cherish the values of this rare personality who has been an inspiration not only to the college but across the 
            nation as well. </pre>
